Okay, the error message "Missing or insufficient permissions" clearly indicates that your Firebase Security Rules for Firestore are not allowing your application to read the `plants` collection (and likely the `categories` collection too, as it's a similar operation).

This is a common issue when starting with Firebase. By default, Firestore rules are often restrictive.

Here's how to fix it:

**1. Update Your Firestore Security Rules:**

You need to go to your Firebase project console and update the security rules for Firestore.

*   **Go to your Firebase Project:** Open the Firebase Console ([console.firebase.google.com](console.firebase.google.com)) and select your project (`galedgreen-956ed`).
*   **Navigate to Firestore Database:** In the left-hand menu, click on "Firestore Database" under the "Build" section.
*   **Go to the "Rules" Tab:** At the top of the Firestore Database page, you'll see tabs like "Data", "Rules", "Indexes", etc. Click on "Rules".

*   **Edit Your Rules:** You'll see the current rules. You need to modify them to allow read access to your collections.

    Here's an example of rules that allow public read access to `plants` and `categories`, and `settings` which is good for now, but restricts writes to authenticated users (you'll need to refine this later for admin-only writes):

    ```javascript
    rules_version = '2';

    service cloud.firestore {
      match /databases/{database}/documents {

        // Allow anyone to read plants and categories
        match /plants/{plantId} {
          allow read: if true;
          allow write: if request.auth != null; // Placeholder: Restrict to admin later
        }

        match /categories/{categoryId} {
          allow read: if true;
          allow write: if request.auth != null; // Placeholder: Restrict to admin later
        }

        // Orders might need more specific rules, e.g., only authenticated users can create,
        // and only specific users (or admin) can read/update them.
        // For now, let's allow authenticated users to create, and admin to read/update.
        match /orders/{orderId} {
          allow create: if request.auth != null;
          allow read, update: if request.auth != null; // You might want to restrict read to specific users or admin
          allow delete: if request.auth != null; // Or admin only
        }
        
        // Settings - allow anyone to read, only authenticated (admin) to write
        match /settings/{documentId} {
          allow read: if true;
          allow write: if request.auth != null; // Placeholder: Restrict to admin later
        }
      }
    }
    ```

*   **Publish Changes:** After editing the rules, click the "Publish" button.

**Explanation of the Rules:**

*   `rules_version = '2';`: Specifies the version of the rules syntax.
*   `service cloud.firestore { ... }`: Defines rules for Firestore.
*   `match /databases/{database}/documents { ... }`: Matches all documents in your database.
*   `match /plants/{plantId}`: Applies the following rules to any document within the "plants" collection.
    *   `allow read: if true;`: This line allows anyone (authenticated or not) to read data from the "plants" collection.
    *   `allow write: if request.auth != null;`: This line (as a starting point) allows any authenticated user to write (create, update, delete) to the "plants" collection. You'll want to make this more specific later (e.g., check for an admin custom claim).
*   The rules for `categories` and `settings` are similar, allowing public read.
*   The rules for `orders` are slightly more restrictive, typically allowing creation by authenticated users and read/update by specific users or admins.

**Important Security Note:**

The `allow read: if true;` rule makes your plant and category data publicly readable. This is suitable for a public catalog. However, **for write operations (creating, updating, deleting data), you should implement proper authentication and authorization.** The `allow write: if request.auth != null;` is a basic step. You'll eventually want to ensure only authorized administrators can modify the data. This often involves:

1.  **Setting up Firebase Authentication:** Ensure you have an authentication system in place (e.g., Email/Password, Google Sign-In).
2.  **Admin Roles:** Implement a way to distinguish admin users (e.g., custom claims in Firebase Auth).
3.  **Refining Write Rules:** Update the `allow write` rules to check if `request.auth.token.admin == true` (or similar, depending on your admin role setup).

**After Updating Rules:**

1.  **Wait a few moments:** It might take a minute or two for the new rules to propagate.
2.  **Refresh your application:** Hard refresh your application in the browser (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R).

If you still encounter issues, double-check:
*   **Collection Names:** Ensure the collection names in your Firestore rules (`plants`, `categories`, `orders`, `settings`) exactly match the names you used in your `service` files and in the `migrateData.ts` script. Case sensitivity matters.
*   **Firebase Project:** Confirm you're editing the rules for the correct Firebase project linked to your application.

This change should resolve the permission denied error for reading data. Remember to revisit and tighten your security rules, especially for write operations, as you develop the admin functionality.
